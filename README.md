# RushOrm 
### Object-relational mapping for Android

RushOrm replaces the need for SQL by mapping java classes to SQL tables.
<hr>

### What is the aim?
The aim is to abstract away all SQLite interaction under a very simple interface to make object storage incredibly quick to implement.
<hr>

### What projects is it right for?
<ul>
    <li>Projects with complex data structures</li>
    <li>Projects that want to implement database storage in the minimum amount of time</li>
    <li>Projects that talk to a rest api</li>
</ul>
<hr>

### Why was RushOrm written?
<ul>
    <li>Complex relationships - RushObjects support Lists of other RushObjects</li>
    <li>SQL free migration</li>
    <li>Easily extendable</li>
    <li>No dependencies</li>
    <li>Support asynchronous call</li>
    <li>Be fast through compound inserts and selects</li>
    <li>Support importing and exporting data to and from JSON</li>
    <li>Unique ids to support merging databases</li>
    <li>Supports conflict resolution when importing data</li>
</ul>
While there are a number of other ORMs, the areas many seem to fall short is the support of 'one to many' relationships, migration and extensions. While claiming all the same basic feature of most other ORMs RushOrm supports 'List' properties without having to add the parent object to it's children. It also handles migrating the class structure without any SQL scripts being required by the developer. Finally it is designed with the understanding that not every situation can be anticipated so instead it can be easily customized.
